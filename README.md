# JS Genetic Algorithm Template

This is a template for a basic genetic algorithm in JavaScript. Can be expanded upon to use NEAT. It uses the p5.js library for drawing and game logic.

## Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TylerMommsen/js-genetic-algorithm-template.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd js-genetic-algorithm-template
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file to run the simulation.

   a. Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.

   OR

   b. Use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code:

   - Install the Live Server extension if you haven't already.
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file in the VS Code file explorer.
   - Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
   - This will start a local development server and open the project in your default browser.

4. To modify the genetic algorithm parameters, edit the `sketch.js` file:

   - Adjust `popSize` to change the population size
   - Modify `mutationRate` to alter the mutation rate

5. Customize the `Player`, `Brain`, and `Population` classes in their respective files to fit your specific use case.
